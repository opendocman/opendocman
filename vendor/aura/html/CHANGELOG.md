## 2.4.1

This release modifies the testing structure and updates other support files.


## 2.4.0

This release fixes a bug in Checkbox/Radio helpers by adding a feature. Previously, the helpers used strict checking of values, which was an unintentional holdover from previous versions. They both now have a strict() method, just like the Select helper, that allows you to turn strict checking off and on. The default is "off."

It also includes a fix to the Escaper encoding lists: they were previously using "iso8859-" and now use "iso-8859-" (note the added dash, per the listing at http://php.net/manual/en/mbstring.supported-encodings.php).

Finally, the links, metas, scripts, styles, and title helpers now allow one-off use by passing values directly to the helper invocation. See the updated documentation for these helpers for more information.


## 2.3.0

This release has SECURITY FIXES. All users are encouraged to upgrade immediately.

- SEC: The AbstractChecked helper, which is the parent for Radio and Checkbox, now HTML-escapes the label. Previously, no escaping was applied.
- SEC: The Textarea helper now HTML-escapes the value. Previously, no escaping was applied.
