Graham Jones' ToDo List for OpenDocMan
======================================

I like the simplicity of OpenDocMan compared to other open source offerings,
so intend to use it for the document management system for the school where
I am a governor.

The current (July 2013) version does not do everything that I want for
that application, so will make some changes to it, which the original author
may like to incorporate into the main software.

The changes I intend to make are:

1.  ~~Make the document revision number available to the main document list template (out.tpl) - DONE (07/07/2013)~~
2.  ~~Make the document category available to the main document list template (out.tpl) - DONE (11/07/2013)~~
3.  ~~Make User Defined Fields (UDFs) available to the main document list template (out.tpl) - DONE (11/07/2013)~~
4.  Make it possible to view issued documents if not logged in - default screen when not logged in should be a file list, with a link to the login screen.
5.  Store the issued version of files as PDFs and serve these when the 'view' action is used.   The native file should only be provided on check-out.
