// LDAP/Active Directory extensions for OpenDocMan
//
// Initial release - John E.P. Hynes, HyTronix [03/29/2015]

	In this initial release, this is what the LDAP extensions do:

	- If a user exists in LDAP, but not in ODM, an ODM user will be created
	- If the user exists in ODM, that user's ODM data will be updated from LDAP 
	- When a new user is created, values can be pulled from LDAP attributes 
	- If the user does not exist in LDAP, authentication will fall through to ODM

	Therefore, you *can* have user accounts in ODM that are not in LDAP.

	What you'll need to use LDAP (besides the ODM prerequisites):

	1) PHP LDAP extensions
	2) An accessible LDAP directory
	3) Knowledge of where the user accounts are in the directory, and how to find them
	4) PHP SSL extensions, if you're going to use LDAPS

	SETUP:

	First, enable LDAP by setting $GLOBALS['CONFIG']['ldap_enable'] to TRUE.  Fill in the correct
values in ldap_host, ldap_port, base_dn (the container where user accounts are stored), searchfilter 
(filter for searching for the unique usernames in that container), bind_dn (a user with the rights 
to bind to and read the user entries in the directory), and bind_pw (the bind_user's password).

	Next, fill out the ODM-DB->LDAP attribute mappings in the config file.  They're all explained
in further detail there.

	One note - if you delete a user from LDAP, the user wil still exist in ODM if they've ever
logged in.  If this is a problem, they can be removed in several ways - if you need/want that feature, drop me a line.

	That's it, for now.  Comments, bug reports and suggestions appreciated.

	TODO:  Add LDAP options to installer and admin panels.
